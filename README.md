# libft - 42 Silicon Valley

This is the first project into 42's curriculum. It serves as a reminder after the one month intensive basic training that introduced us to C, and dives deeper into the language. The goal here is to (re)develop some basics functions of C standard library to build our own library that we will use and grow along all our other projects. 

Why rebuild existing functions? To gain a real understanding for each of them and be conscious of what happens behind the scene from the very beginning of C programmation.

# What functions are included?

1. Libc functions.
2. Additional functions.
3. Bonus functions.
4. Personal functions (will grow along other projects).
